#appoftheyear website competition.
ive created this website for the fnb app academy competition.with very little data i was able to create a basic website showing off my skills ive learnt at #appoftheyear.
this website is based on a business i would like to open when i have funding.
ive used HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT to create my website.
